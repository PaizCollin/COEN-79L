Santa Clara University, Dr. Darren Atkinson/Dr. Yuhong Liu, Winter 2021

This includes various C++ projects from the lab section of this course. Some files were provided by the professor (Without "My"). My implementations and work are specified in directories that include "My". Directories that include "Ian" were used to create test cases for a partner in the course.

Lab 1 - Various Programs: Count the number of alphanumeric and nonalphanumeric characters in the user input; print a string and its reverse; delete nonalphanumeric characters in words larger than 10 characters, convert to uppercase and print; user thinks of a number 1-20 and the program attempts to guess it

Lab 2 - Statistician/Pseudorandom Number Generator (OOP Functions): Implement a statistician class. Generate pseudorandom integers

Lab 3 - Sequence (Bags): Implement an ordered bag class

Lab 4 - Keyed Bag/Polynomials (Keyed Bags): Implement a keyed bag with arrays. Specify, design, and implement a class for polynomials

Lab 5 - String (STL String Class): Implements a version of the STL string class

Lab 6 - Node/Sequence (Linked Lists): Implement the linked list toolkit functions and implement the sequence class

Lab 7 - Database (Dynamic Arrays): Implement an array of company elements on a heap. Add companies and products to a database

Lab 8 - Deque (Deque): Implement a deque class and a forward iterator

Lab 9 - Bag Binary Search Tree (Bag, BST): Implement the bag template class using a BST to store items
