TESTING METHOD FOR POLYNOMIAL PROGRAM

POSITIVE TESTS:
1. Assign 4x^2
Report: Works
2. Add 3x^4
Report: Works
3. View the polynomial
Report: Works
4. Change polynomial to B
Report: Works, outputs 0 as expected
5. Evaluate at x = 5
Report: Works, outputs 1975 as expected
6. Assign 5x^3 to B, view A + B
Report: Works, outputs 3x^4 + 5x^3 + 4x^2 as expected
7. View A - B
Report: Works, outputs 3x^4 - 5x^3 + 4x^2 as expected
8. Set A = 2x^2, set B = 4x^3, view A * B
Report: Works, outputs 8x^5 as expected
9. View next and previous term for A @ degree = 3
Report: Works
10. View derivative of A
Report: Works, outputs 4x as expected
11. Clear A and B
Report: Works, both polynomials are set to 0 as expected
12. Assign 2x^2 and then add 2x^2
Report: Works, outputs 4x^2 as expected
13. Assign 5x^2 while 4x^2 already exists
Report: Works, outputs 5x^2 as expected

NEGATIVE TESTS:
1. Set polynomial to work on as D
Report: Works, does not allow setting to polynomial D as expected
2. Assign new term with degree = 30
Report: Assertion fails as expected
3. Assign new term with degree = -5
Report: Assertion fails as expected
4. View derivative of 0
Report: Outputs 0 as expected
5. Evaluate 0 @ x = 5
Report: Outputs 0 as expected

BOUNDARY TESTS:
1. Set coefficient to 9007199254740992 (max value of double with precision)
Report: Works
2. Set coefficient to 9007199254740993
Report: Outputs 9007199254740992.0 instead of 9007199254740993.0 as expected
(NOTE: using 9007199254740995 outputs 9007199254740996.0)
3. Fill the polynomial from degree 1 to degree 29
Report: Does not add item of degree 29 NOT EXPECTED
4. Assign item with degree 29
Report: Does not add item of degree 29 NOT EXPECTED
