Test results (I am assuming I only test the implementations done by my lab partner, for the sake of time)

ROUND 1:
POSITIVE TESTS:
1. create a database
Result: Works, db1 created
2. insert_company 3 companies
Result: Works, companies inserted
3. print_companies
Result: Works, companies are printed
4. create database from source
Result: Works, db2 created from db1 (tested by printing)
5. database =
Result: Works, db3 is set equal to db1 (tested by printing)
6. insert_item
Result: Works, db1, C1 now has product '1' for $1.00
7. print_items_by_company
Result: Works, C1 items are printed
8. erase_item an item from the middle
Result: Works, item is removed from company C1
9. erase_item an item from the front (boundary)
Result: Works, item is removed from comapny C1
10. erase_item an item from the back (boundary)
Result: Works, item is removed from company C1
11. erase_company from the middle
Result: Works, company C3 is removed from db2
12. erase_company from the front (boundary)
Result: Works, comapny C1 is removed from db2
13. erase_company from the back (boundary)
Result: Works, company C5 is removed from db2
14. search_company C1
Result: Works, company found, location number printed

NEGATIVE TESTS:
1. database with incorrect argument type
Result: Fails
2. database from unknown source
Result: Fails, database source does not exist
3. database = from unknown source
Result: Fails, database source does not exist
4. print_companies from an empty db7
Result: Passes, but nothing is printed
5. print_items_by_company from a company that doesnt exist
Result: assertion failed. aborted
6. insert_company with an empty string
Result: assertion failed. aborted
7. insert_item with empty item names
Result: assertion failed, aborted
8. erase_company that doesnt exist
Result: Passes, test returns that there was no company to be deleted based on return bool
9. erase_item that doesnt exist
Result: Passes, told that there was no item to deleted
10. erase_item with no company name or product name given
Result: assertion failed, aborted
11. search_company of company that doesnt exist
Result: passes, -1 printed
12. search_company entry is empty
Result: assertion failed, aborted

BOUNDARY TESTS:
1. insert_item with price as max double
Result: Works, value is inputted
2. insert_item with price as max double +1
Result: Passes, but value is only the max double
(A few others are in the positive tests and labeled)
